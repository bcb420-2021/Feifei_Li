### Before you compile...

In the YAML metadata of `A3_Feifei_Li.Rmd`:

* Change `isWindows` to `FALSE` if you are not compiling on a host machine running Windows OS.
* Change `host_machine_dir` to the directory where you pull this repository. e.g.
** Windows OS:
** MacOS/Linus:

Generated plots will be stored under `./img/` directory. You might delete the directory once the compilation is complete.
